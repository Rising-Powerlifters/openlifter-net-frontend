    <p>OpenLifter is provided completely free of charge, but without meet-day support.</p>
    <p>If you would like technical support for your meet, the OpenPowerlifting team offers several services &mdash; from walking you through the software and making sure things are set up correctly, all the way to in-person score table direction and training for your staff.</p>
    <p>Our globally-distributed team has decades of experience running premier powerlifting meets, including Boss of Bosses and the Kern US Open. We have worked as spotters, loaders, judges, announcers, and expediters. We've run score tables and literally written the software. We know how to run great, speedy meets.</p>
    <p>We'd love to help your meet be the best it can be.</p>
